# About TeamOps

**TeamOps** is an internal operations tool designed for **remote-first teams** to manage users, teams, projects, and tasks in a structured and transparent way.

The goal of this project is to simulate how real-world remote teams coordinate work, track progress, and maintain accountability **without relying on constant meetings**.

---

## Why TeamOps Exists

Remote teams often face challenges such as:
- Lack of visibility into ongoing work
- Unclear ownership of tasks
- Difficulty tracking progress across teams
- Over-dependence on sync meetings

TeamOps addresses these problems by centralizing:
- Team structure
- Project ownership
- Task assignments
- Progress tracking

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

This project is built as a **portfolio-grade backend application** and focuses on real engineering fundamentals, including:

- Secure authentication using JWT and HttpOnly cookies
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Member)
- Clean separation of concerns (routes, controllers, services, models)
- Centralized error handling
- Type-safe Express application with TypeScript
- Realistic data modeling for teams, projects, and tasks
- Production-minded project structure

---

## Scope of the Project

TeamOps is intentionally built as an **internal tool**, not a public SaaS product.  
This allows the focus to stay on:
- Correct architecture
- Backend reliability
- Security best practices
- Developer experience

Rather than UI polish or marketing features.

---

## Intended Audience

- Hiring managers reviewing backend or MERN projects
- Developers learning how to structure real-world APIs
- Anyone interested in how internal tools for remote teams are built

---

## Project Philosophy

> Build realistic systems, not demo apps.

TeamOps prioritizes:
- Simplicity over over-engineering
- Clear architecture over unnecessary abstractions
- Real-world use cases over tutorial-style examples
